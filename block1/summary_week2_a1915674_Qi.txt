Practice problem/Exam and number:

Week:	2



*******************
* Description  * 
*******************


1. List the problems you attempted, and Java API Classes and methods you used to solve each problem.

[Eg. SlowKeyBoard: ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort]

Problem1:
no problem


Problem2:
String and char cannot be compared directly, type conversion is required

* Challenges  * 
*******************
2. What challenges have you faced to solve the given problems?

Problem1:
This problem was very simple for me. I finished writing it in just 5 minutes. However, I encountered many problems when using Gradescope.
The teacher in the workshop helped me solve them.

Problem2:
I had never used Java to deal with this kind of matrix problem before, so I spent a lot of time thinking.
Because my personal solution involves a triple loop, it is difficult to debug.

************************
* Solution Approach  *
************************

3. Discuss how you approach the problem and how you solve the problem.
For question 1, after reading all the content, I felt that a loop was needed. My first instinct was to use a while loop,
and the result was correct, so I didn't try a for loop. Then, the modulus of 0 can be used as a condition.
If the modulus result is 0, the leaf will be eaten, and cnt++ is used to obtain the final number.

For question 2, this problem is much more complex than the previous one. Initially, I thought I'd need at least two loops—one for rows
and one for columns. But when I tried to implement it, I realized that after getting the position of the number,
I still needed to start a loop to compare the numbers. So I thought, could I start a loop from 0 to 9, since there are only 10 numbers?
But when I tried to implement this method, I found that it was still too complicated, even requiring another loop to find the result.
So I abandoned my previous plan. It took me a while to figure out the concept of offsets, and then I had the code complete.
However, the code was difficult to debug, so I asked chatGPT for help.

4. What did you learn from the problem? How this problem type of problems will help you to be a better problem solver?
These questions are still quite simple to me, I didn't learn much from them

5. Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic design,  coding)?
algorithmic design and speed.

6. What are your goals for the next practice problems? 
I hope I can complete the basic algorithm writing more proficiently

7. Have you used any AI tool such as ChatGPT? How have you used it and explain this tool is helping you to be a better problem solver?
After I finished writing the code and debugged it several times, I asked gpt to help check for code bugs.
I know what code I want and what code is correct. AI tools can greatly reduce debugging time.
