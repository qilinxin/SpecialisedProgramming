Practice problem/Exam and number:

Week:	1



*******************
* Description  * 
*******************


1. List the problems you attempted, and Java API Classes and methods you used to solve each problem.

[Eg. SlowKeyBoard: ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort]

Problem1:
no problem


Problem2:
Unable to understand what needs to be done

*******************
* Challenges  * 
*******************
2. What challenges have you faced to solve the given problems?

Problem1:
After writing, the test passed.

Problem2:
I had trouble understanding the content of the question. After reading it for more than 10 minutes, I still didn't know what to do.
I think it would be easier to understand if "the absolute value of their difference" in the question was changed to the ASCII difference,
and "distance" was changed to the sum of the differences in the ASCII code values.

************************
* Solution Approach  *
************************

3. Discuss how you approach the problem and how you solve the problem.
The first question needs to be processed by a loop. Different colors are processed differently in the loop, but the order of the
initial colors is fixed, so it is easy to handle. Adding the processing logic after the ball is hit, the whole is very easy to write.

The difficulty for me in the second question was understanding the task content. I was a little confused after reading it for a long time.
After understanding the content, the coding difficulty was also very low. Iterate through the string, use the subscript to get the
letter corresponding to the other string, get the difference and put it into a list. Arrange the list in ascending order,
then use K to loop, and delete the largest element as long as the difference is not 0. Finally, summarize the value of distance

4. What did you learn from the problem? How this problem type of problems will help you to be a better problem solver?
These questions are still quite simple to me, I didn't learn much from coding

5. Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic design,  coding)?
algorithmic design and speed.

6. What are your goals for the next practice problems? 
I hope I can complete the basic algorithm writing more proficiently

7. Have you used any AI tool such as ChatGPT? How have you used it and explain this tool is helping you to be a better problem solver?
I use chatGPT to help me understand the second question. But all the code were written by myself. The tool help me understand the task
and reduce misunderstandings.
