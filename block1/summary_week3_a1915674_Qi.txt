1. List the problems you attempted, and Java API Classes and methods you used to solve each problem.

[Eg. SlowKeyBoard: ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort]

Problem1:
Math.floor, Math.sqrt, Forced type conversion

Problem2:
Array and list conversion

* Solution Approach  *

3. Discuss how you approach the problem and how you solve the problem.
The first problem that comes to mind is the loop. Since the data must be different, so we can use the square root method to get the
upper limit of the loop and add data verification in the loop.

The first thing that comes to mind for the second question is that the number of boys and girls must be the same, so the total number
must be a multiple of two, and the male and female hosts need to be consistent on the left and right sides, so the number must be
divisible by four. I am more familiar with the API corresponding to the list, so I converted the array into a list, and then used the
lambda expression to filter and sort to get the content I need. The number of boys and girls must be the same. In this case, the boys'
list is used as the base, and the data in the girls' list is inserted into the boys' list. Notice that the subscripts of the first half
and the second half are different because the logic after the female host is inconsistent. In the generated list, the subscript of the
female host must be half of the list length, and finally insert HOST at the first place in the list.


4. What did you learn from the problem? How this problem type of problems will help you to be a better problem solver?
After implementing the function, I asked the AI tool to help me optimize the code, and found that there are still many parts that can
be improved.

5. Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic design,  coding)?
algorithmic design and speed.

6. What are your goals for the next practice problems? 
Ability to think more comprehensively about the code execution process, improving code robustness and execution efficiency

7. Have you used any AI tool such as ChatGPT? How have you used it and explain this tool is helping you to be a better problem solver?
After finishing these questions, I asked ChatGPT for suggestions for improvement. There’s still a lot I can work on,
and learning from its reasoning will help me write better code.
