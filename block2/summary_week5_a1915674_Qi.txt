Practice problem/Exam and number:

Week:	5



*******************
* Description  * 
*******************


1. List the problems you attempted, and Java API Classes and methods you used to solve each problem.

[Eg. SlowKeyBoard: ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort]

Problem1:
Math.floor, Math.sqrt, Forced type conversion

Problem2:
Array and list conversion

* Challenges  * 
*******************
2. What challenges have you faced to solve the given problems?

Problem1:
I thought about how to judge whether it is a bribe for a long time, but I couldn't figure it out because the amount is different. Finally, I used AI tools to
find out that the key point of this problem is dp[i][c] = the maximum deterrent value d that can be achieved after dealing with the first i monsters and the total cost is c.

Problem2:
The biggest challenge was understanding how backtracking + pruning worked in this problem, which was completely new to me.

Problem3:
FibonacciDiv2 is relatively simple to implement. I immediately thought of generating the Fibonacci sequence for data comparison. Overall, there are not many challenges.

Problem4:
The challenge for me is to split the sub-problems and write recursive functions. Although I have written recursion before, they were all simple ones such as Fibonacci.
I have never written recursion with relatively complex logic. At present, I have no idea of how to deal with algorithmic problems and I am not proficient enough.

* Solution Approach  *
************************

3. Discuss how you approach the problem and how you solve the problem.

The questions in week 5 were a bit difficult for me. I only understood the code given by AI, so I can't provide a specific solution.
I will practice more related questions and strive to complete them independently next week.

4. What did you learn from the problem? How this problem type of problems will help you to be a better problem solver?
After implementing the function, I asked the AI tool to help me optimize the code, and found that there are still many parts that can
be improved.

5. Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic design, coding)?
Algorithmic,I can hardly understand this week's exercises without the help of AI tools. I still have some shortcomings in algorithms and need more practice.

6. What are your goals for the next practice problems?
Try to complete the related exercises independently, instead of waiting for AI to give you the solution and then trying to understand each step like this week.

7. Have you used any AI tool such as ChatGPT? How have you used it and explain this tool is helping you to be a better problem solver?
I used chatgpt during this practice. I spent at least half an hour on each question. I had some rough ideas, but it was difficult to write them and I couldn't
complete the function. So I asked AI to provide the complete code and then I understood it myself.
